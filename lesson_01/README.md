# OpenGL Drawing Project

This project is designed to demonstrate the use of OpenGL drawing libraries in Python. It provides a simple framework for rendering graphics using either Processing or Raylib with Python bindings.

## Project Structure

```
opengl-drawing-project
├── src
│   ├── main.py        # Entry point of the application
│   └── utils.py       # Utility functions for OpenGL operations
├── requirements.txt    # List of dependencies
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd opengl-drawing-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:
```
python src/main.py
```

## Main Functionalities

- **OpenGL Context Initialization**: The application sets up an OpenGL context for rendering.
- **Rendering Loop**: A main loop that continuously renders graphics on the screen.
- **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for loading textures, handling user input, and managing shapes.
